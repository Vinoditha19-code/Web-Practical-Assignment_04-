01. Create a Database
The Library database was successfully created. It will hold all collections and documents related to the library system.

02. Create Collections
Three collections—libraries, books, and authors—were created. These collections will store data about branches, books, and authors respectively.

03. Insert Sample Documents
Sample records were correctly added to each collection. Relationships between books, authors, and libraries were established using ObjectIds.

04. Find All Books in the "Central Library"
Books belonging to the “Central Library” were successfully retrieved using the library's ObjectId.

05. List All Libraries with the Number of Books
Each library and the number of books it holds were correctly displayed using aggregation. This helps in comparing branch book counts.

06. Find All Books by "J.K. Rowling"
Books written by "J.K. Rowling" were found by matching her author ID. This shows how to filter books by specific authors.

07. List All Authors with the Books They Wrote
Each author was listed with their corresponding books. This reveals which author wrote which books.

08. Find All Books with Their Authors’ Details
Each book was shown along with its authors' names and birth years. This merges book and author data for better insights.

09. List All Libraries with Book Count (Including Those with None)
Libraries were shown with book counts even if they had zero books. This gives a full view of all library branches.

10. Calculate Average Number of Books Per Library
The average number of books held by each library was calculated. This provides a general idea of book distribution.

11. Find Authors with More Than One Book
Only authors who have written more than one book were displayed. This helps identify prolific authors in the database.

12. Get Books with Authors' Names and Library Name
Each book was listed with its authors' names and the library it belongs to. This combines data from all three collections.

13. List Authors Who Haven’t Written Any Books
Authors without any books in the system were identified. This can help manage unused author records or plan future book additions.
